# ProtSol

A novel approach to predict  the protein solubility based on the protein sequence.

## Files and folders:

**best_model:** the best performing model in paper.  

**checkpoint:** stores the best breakpoints in the training process.  

**data:** the training set, test set, NESG set and Chang set used for training, testing and validation.  

**model:** the BERT model uesd for ProtSol.  

**log:** the folder to save the train log.

**Predict:** the folder used for prediction, please provide the fasta format file as in the example.  

**predict.py:** predicts the soluble tags corresponding to the amino acid sequences of the own dataset and outputs them to the file y_hat_own_data.csv.  

**Solubilitylib.py:** some basic libraries for the model, mainly for data processing, both training and prediction will be used.  

**train.py:** used for the model training process.

## 0. Environment

If you wanna run this model on your own linux servicer, plz git clone the ProtSol through the code below:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/binbinbinv/ProtSol.git
```

and then install the environment through the code below, but make sure you have installed the conda or miniconda on your servicer:

```shell
cd ProtSol/
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

If you encounter errors while installing the conda environment using the environment.yml file, please follow the instructions below and run each command one by one to install the ProtSol conda environment：

```shell
conda create -n ProtSol python=3.8
conda activate ProtSol
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install pandas bio seaborn matplotlib_inline
pip install scikit-learn transformers Ipython
pip install iFeatureOmegaCLI rdkit
```

and then activate conda environment of ProtSol:

```shell
conda activate ProtSol
cd ProtSol/
```

Please make sure you have downloaded all files according to the readme file inside the corresponding folders.:  
**best_model**  
**model**
    
If you wanna run the predict.py and train.py on GPU, make sure your gpu has more than 24G of CUDA memory!

## 1. Predict your own sequences

Put your protein data in fasta format in the **./Predict/NEED_TO_PREPARE/own_data.fasta** folder, and make sure your data is in the same format as the example given.

Please do not change the name of the file "own_data.fasta". If you have multiple sequences, please place them all in one file named "own_data.fasta" as per the provided example.

Then run the command below:

```shell
python predict.py
```

You will get the output in ./Predict/Output.csv

## 2. Retrain the model

If you wanna retrain the model, please ensure that you have at least 24GB of available GPU memory. The training process lasts approximately 40 epochs, with each epoch taking at least 1 hour. In total, it will take around 2 days, depending on the computational power of your GPU.

Then run the code below:

```shell
python train.py
```
